companyname timed assignment
============================

A timed assignment I did for some company. Re-uploaded to remove their
name from it (so people don't look it up).

The only reason this is here is because when I attempted to send the
zip over gmail, it was rejected for looking like malware. I mean, I
suppose malware contains code too, but still...

q1 usage
--------

```shell
cd event-logger
yarn
npm start
```

q2 usage
--------

didn't finish the part that cmps the daterange

`python delivery-stats.py`

notes for anybody looking at this (besides the company)
-------------------------------------------------------

If you're another company evaluating me: this is not my finest hour,
coding-assignment wise. Please ignore this and let me do your own
problem instead.

If you're a young engineer trying to learn about the hiring process: I
don't think this is all that typical as far as timed assignments go,
so you probably won't get much out of looking at this.
